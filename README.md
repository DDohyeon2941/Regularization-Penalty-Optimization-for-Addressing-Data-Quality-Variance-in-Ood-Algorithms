## 1) Base_experiment.py : Experiment without considering the OOD generalization
## 2) IRM_experiment.py : Experiment with IRM algorithm which is the base model for this paper
## 3) IRM_ver1_experiment.py : Experiment with modified IRM algorithm where the values of domain-level weights are estimated for each of the domain
## 4) IRM_rev_experiment.py : Experiment with proposed model (paper) where both the domain-level and sample level regularizers are added to the original IRM algorithm.
